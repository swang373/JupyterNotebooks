    ">First, determine the number of days you worked during 2015 before the foreign job started or after it ended. Divide that number by the total days you worked during the entire year. Then, multiply the result by your 2015 income. The result is the amount you earned before or after the foreign job. You must deduct this amount from your earned income before you figure out how much of your income can be applied to the foreign earned income exclusion. We'll help you with this in TurboTax."
