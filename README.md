# Lynda Notes

The University of Florida provides access to Lynda, an online educational service boasting a wealth of videos with
experts teaching a variety of useful topics. Not that you couldn't learn about these topics by googling around, but
I find these lessons to be thorough and convenient. And my tuition is paying for it, so why not? I'll be working
through some essential training courses on coding and software. Some of the finance videos may be useful, too.

I wanted to begin using [IPython notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) and familiarizing myself with 
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), so I'll upload whatever notes I take since GitHub 
beautifully renders IPython notebooks! =D
