    "---\n",
    "**Improvement 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "Known as \"weighted quick-union\", the approach is to modify quick-union to avoid tall trees by keeping track of the size of each tree (number of objects), balancing them by linking the root of the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree. Alternatively, can union according to height or \"rank\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Structure:** Same as quick-union, but maintain extra array `sz[i]` to count number of objects in the tree rooted at `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Find:** Identical to quick-union.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Union:** Modified from quick-union to link root of smaller tree to root of larger tree and update the `sz[]` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proposition:** Depth of any node *x* is at most lg*N* (base 2).\n",
    ">Proof: The depth of *x* increases by 1 when tree *T*1 containing *x* is merged into another tree *T*2. The size of the tree containing *x* at least doubles since |*T*2| ≥ |*T*1|, but it can only double at most lg*N* times.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Running Time:** Find takes time proportional to depth of *p* and *q*. Union takes constant time, given roots. In terms of order of growth, initialization is *O*(*N*), union is *O*(lg*N*) (including the cost of finding the roots), and find is at worst *O*(lg*N*), based on the proposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improvement 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "Known as \"path compression\", modify the algorithm such that after computing the root of *p*, set the id of each examined node to point to that root. This only costs constant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proposition:** [Hopcroft-Ulman, Tarjan] Starting from an empty data structure, any sequence of *M* union-find ops on *N* objects makes ≤ *c*(*N* + *M*lg\\**N*) array accesses, where lg\\* is the iterative log function. Analysis can be improved to *N* + *M*α(*M*,*N*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there a linear-time algorithm for *M* union-find ops on *N* objects? No, weighted quick-union with path compression (WQUPC) is not quite linear in theory, but it might as well be in practice.\n",
